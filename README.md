# Readable Project

This project is the final requirement to complete  Udacity's Redux course. In this project was build an application where the user can create content (Posts) to be showed on the website, as the same way that users can comment and rate (posts and comments).

## Start Application

To get application follow these steps:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd readable-api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, use Create React App to scaffold out the front-end
    - `cd readable-view`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
